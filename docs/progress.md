# Progress log

## Phase 2 – Express skeleton & project structure
- Initialized Node project, added Express/dotenv/OpenAI dependencies.
- Created core structure: `server/` with routes/services stubs, `admin/`, `widget/`, `test/`, and `.env.example`.
- Added static serving for `/admin` and `/widget`, health and chat endpoints (stub), and placeholder admin/widget UIs.
- Added README with run instructions and linked docs.

Next: Phase 3 will implement the multi-tenant config service and admin API routes with real in-memory storage and JSON examples in `docs/architecture.md`.
